# Browser-based Discord Account Creator - Version Tracker
This repository is automatically updated to track the latest version of the **Browser-based Discord Account Creator**.

## ⚠️ Important Warning
**This repository is used exclusively for update checking and version management.**

- The `VERSION` file contains the latest commit hash or version tag from the main project.
- The main application checks this repository to determine if a new update is available.

## How it works
When a new commit is pushed to the main repository, a GitHub Action automatically updates the `VERSION` file here. This allows the client application to detect updates and notify the user.
